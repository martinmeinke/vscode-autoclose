# autoclose README

After hours of jumping from file to file I usually end up with tons of open tabs, having a hard time closing the ones that are not relevant anymore.
Autoclose automatically closes Vscode tabs that have not been accessed in some time.


## Extension Settings


This extension contributes the following settings:

* `autoclose.ageInSeconds`: Close tabs that have not been activated this long. 

Hint: Closing and reopening your workspace will **not** reset the timers. Even if you close & reopen your workspace multiple times, inactive files will still be closed.

## Known Issues

None so far, let me know!
