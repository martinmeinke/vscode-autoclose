# autoclose README

After hours of jumping from file to file I usually end up with tons of open tabs, having a hard time closing the ones that are not relevant anymore.
The Autoclose extension automatically closes vscode tabs that have not been accessed in some time, only keeping recently used editors open.


## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `autoclose.ageInSeconds`: Close tabs that have not been activated this long. 
* `autoclose.closeDirtyEditor`: Close files even if the editor has unsaved modifications.

Hint: Closing and reopening your workspace will **not** reset the timers. Even if you close & reopen your workspace multiple times, inactive files will still be closed.

## Known Issues

None so far, let me know!
